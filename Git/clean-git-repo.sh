# This script is rather destructive: it reverts the working directory
# to a pristine state, like after doing the first "git clone".
# All files, include .gitignore'd files, are deleted.
#
# Such a clean directory can be used, for example, to test a build from scratch.
# However, for this purpose alone, "git stash --all" is probably a better choice.
# Or check out to a separate directory, or do a "git clone --shared",
# or create a new shallow clone somewhere else.

# git-clean: Remove untracked files from the working tree.
#   -d: Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files.
#   -x: Donâ€™t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore etc.
