Office Software Automation Scripts

These scripts try to generate easy-to-understand error messages if some file operation fails.

The .vbs scripts for Windows support user messages in English, German or Spanish.

- PromptAndProcess.vbs

  Sometimes you need to write a small script that lets a user select a file
  and do some operation on it, like convert it to another format.

  This script provides a full-blown example for Microsoft Windows.

- ConvertWordToPDFWithBackground.vbs

  Converts a Microsoft Word document to a PDF file, and then generates a second PDF file
  with extra content in the background (typically a letterhead or watermark) on all pages.

- CopyToOldVersionsArchive.vbs

  Creates an "Archived" subdirectory and copies the given file there.
  The name of the copy gets the current date and time appended to it.

- add-letterhead.sh

  Adds extra content in the background (typically a letterhead or watermark)
  to all pages of a PDF document.
