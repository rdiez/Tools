# This VNC method creates a virtual X server that has nothing to do with the
# physical X server session on the local monitor.
#
# Installation steps are:
#
# - Install package 'tigervnc-standalone-server' for TigerVNC,
#        or package 'tightvncserver' for TightVNC, on the remote host.
#   See variable USE_TIGER below.
#
# - Use tool 'vncpasswd' on the remote host to set the password used to access VNC desktops.
#   Without such a password, any local user can access the local VNC server.
#
#   With TigerVNC we could use UNIX domain sockets, instead of TCP sockets on localhost.
#   SSH can tunnel such sockets too. Linux checks the file permissions of UNIX domain sockets,
#   so you may not need to set a VNC password.
#
# - Copy this script to the remote host.
#
# - Terminate any existing local sessions for the user on the remote host.
#   To do that, you will have to connect to the remote host with SSH or tmux.
#
#   An existing local session on the remote host may cause problems starting a new VNC virtual session,
#   at least for the same user. If you are not in front of the remote PC (so that you cannot log
#   the user account out easily), terminate the existing local session like this:
#      sudo pkill -TERM -u "$USER"
#    or
#      sudo killall -TERM  -u "$USER"
#    or
#      Find out what the existing root session process is.
#      It should be called something like "xfce4-session".
#      Kill it with signal TERM.
#
# - Run this script on the remote host. For example:
#
#   ssh -t -2 RemoteHost  tmux new-session -A -s RemoteVncDesktopSession  /home/user/StartXvncSession.sh  1  800x600
#
#   Use tmux in order for the virtual X server to survive an SSH disconnection.
#
# Another example with run-in-new-console.sh :
#
#   /home/rdiez/rdiez/Tools/RunInNewConsole/run-in-new-console.sh  --console-title="Remote Session" --console-icon="modem" -- "ssh -t -2 RemoteHost  tmux new-session -A -s RemoteVncDesktopSession  /home/user/StartXvncSession.sh  1  800x600"
#
# Because logging out within VNC does not always reliably kill the X server, you can just
# log on to the tmux session and press Ctrl+C to terminate the session.
#
# If you want to connect to the remove host with Vinagre, create an SSH tunnel first:
# On one terminal:
#   ssh -N -L 5901:localhost:5901 RemoteHost
# On another terminal:
#    vinagre ::5901
#
# Remmina can start the SSH tunnel automatically with the following settings:
#
#   Basic settings:
#     Server: localhost:5901
#     User password: VNC server password
#     Colour depth: High colour (16 bpp)
#       Beware that Remmina only works with "High colour (16 bpp)". With "256 colours (8 bpp)" the
#       remote connection window flashes open and then immediately closes.
#
#   SSH Tunnel settings:
#     Enable SSH Tunnel: enabled
#     Custom: RemoteHost:5000  (RemoteHost can be an SSH alias, but the port number must be stated separately here)
#     User name: username  (Necessary, or the connection will hang. Any username in the SSH config will not be honoured.)
#     Select option "Public key (automatic)". Alternatively, select the .key file as the "Identity file".
#
# The Xtightvnc server does not support the xrandr extension, so you cannot change
# the desktop resolution on the fly with xrandr.
# Xtigervnc does support xrandr, but apparently only with fixed resolutions, so it is not much fun to use.
