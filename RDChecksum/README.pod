=head1 OVERVIEW

RDChecksum version 0.56

Creates or verifies a list of file checksums (hashes).

=head1 RATIONALE

In an ideal world, all filesystems would have integrated data checksums like ZFS does.
This tool is a poor man's substitute for such filesystem-level checksums.
It can also help detect data corruption when transferring files over a network.

Storage devices are supposed to use checksums to detect or even correct data errors,
and most transport protocols should do the same. However, computer systems are becoming
more complex and more brittle at the same time.

However, I have very rarely performed a large backup or file copy operation without hitting some data
integrity issue. For example, interrupting with Ctrl+C an rsync transfer to an SMB network share
tends to corrupt the destination files, and resuming the transfer will not fix such corruption.

There are many alternative checksum/hash tools around, but I decided to write a new one out of frustration
with the existing software.

=head1 USAGE

 ./rdchecksum.pl --create [options] [--] [directory]
 ./rdchecksum.pl --verify [options]

Argument 'directory' is optional and defaults to the current directory ('.').

If 'directory' is the current directory ('.'), then the filenames in the checksum list will be like 'file1.txt'.
Otherwise, the filenames will be like 'directory/file1.txt'.

The checksum file itself (FileChecksums.txt by default) and any other temporary files with that basename
will be automatically skipped from the checksum list (assuming that the checksum filename's basedir and
argument 'directory' match, because mixing relative and absolute paths will confuse the script).

Usage examples:

 cd some-directory && /somewhere/rdchecksum.pl --create

 cd some-directory && /somewhere/rdchecksum.pl --verify

Command-line options are read from environment variable RDCHECKSUM_OPTIONS first, and then from the command line.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item *

B<-h, --help>

Print this help text.

=item *

B<--help-pod>

Preprocess and print the POD section. Useful to generate the README.pod file.

=item *

B<--version>

Print this tool's name and version number (0.56).

=item *

B<--license>

Print the license.

=item *

B<-->

Terminate options processing. Useful to avoid confusion between options and filenames
that begin with a hyphen ('-'). Recommended when calling this script from another script,
where the filename comes from a variable or from user input.

=item *

B<< --create  >>

Creates a checksum file.

When creating a checksum file named F<< FileChecksums.txt >>S< >, a temporary file named F<< FileChecksums.txt.inProgress >>
will also be created.

=item *

B<< --verify  >>

Verifies the files listed in the checksum file.

A report file named F<< FileChecksums.txt.verification.report >> will be created. Only failed files will show up in the report.

It is possible to parse the report in order to automatically process the files that failed verification.

=item *

B<< --checksum-file=filename >>

The default filename is FileChecksums.txtS< >.

=item *

B<< --resume-from-line=n >>

Before starting verification, skip (nS< >-S< >1) text lines at the beginning of F<< FileChecksums.txt >>S< >.
This (rather crude) option allows you to manually resume a previous, unfinished verification.

=item *

B<< --verbose >>

Print each filename during processing.

=back

=head1 EXIT CODE

Exit code: 0 on success, some other value on error or if interrupted by a signal.

=head1 SIGNALS

Reception of signals SIGTERM, SIGINT (usually Ctrl+C) and SIGHUP (usually closing the terminal window) make this
script gracefully stop. Most other signals will kill the script straight away.

SIGHUP will probably not be handled as a normal request to stop if you close the terminal,
because writing to sdtout or stderr will fail immediately and will make this script
quit beforehand.

=head1 USING I<< background.sh >>

It is probably most convenient to run this tool with another script of mine called I<< background.sh >>S< >,
so that it runs with low priority and you get a visual notification when finished.

The optional memory limit below reduces the performance impact on other processes by preventing
the checksum operation from flushing the complete Linux filesystem cache. For example:

 export BACKGROUND_SH_LOW_PRIORITY_METHOD="systemd-run"
 cd some-directory
 background.sh --memory-limit=512M /somewhere/rdchecksum.pl --verify

=head1 CHECKSUM FILE

The generated file with the list of checksums looks like this:

 2019-12-31T20:15:01.200  CRC-32  12345678  1,234,567  subdir/file1.txt
 2019-12-31T20:15:01.300  CRC-32  90ABCDEF  2,345,678  subdir/file2.txt

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item *

This tool is rather simple at the moment. The only checksum type supported at the moment ist CRC-32 from zlib.

If you need more features, drop me a line.

=item *

There is no symbolic link loop detection (protection against circular links).

In such a situation, this tool will run forever.
