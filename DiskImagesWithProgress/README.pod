=head1 Disk Images With Progress

Say you want to make an image file from of a disk or partition, and then restore it later.
You can achieve it easily with I<< dd >>:

  sudo dd if=/dev/sdxx  of=$HOME/some/dir/test.diskimage
  sudo dd if=$HOME/some/dir/test.diskimage  of=/dev/sdxx

Let's add a few features:

=over

=item * Display a visual notification at the end.

Copying a disk may take a long time. We will use my I<< background.sh >> tool,
which displays a desktop notification at the end. This tool also lowers the disk priority,
in order to reduce the performance impact on your desktop environment.

If you do not want to use I<< background.sh >>, leave it out from the examples below.

=item * Display a progress bar.

We will use I<< pv >>. There are ways to make it display a dialog with a graphical progress bar,
but we will just display a text progress bar in the current console.

I<< pv >>'s option "-f" ("--force") is necessary if you use I<< background.sh >>. Otherwise,
pv will think it is not outputting to a terminal (but to a I<< tee >> pipe) and will
not generate the progress bar.

=item * Sync the disk cache at the end.

This way, when I<< dd >> has finished, we know that the all the data has been physically written to disk.
Otherwise the data will land in the write-back cache first, and we must not
forget to run I<< sync >> before removing the physical media. See I<< dd >>'s option "oflag=sync" below.

=item * Avoid quickly overloading the system's file cache.

Linux' I<< page cache >> is braindead and will agressively write-cache huge amounts of data at once,
eventually dropping all other cached data. Your desktop environment may be rendered unresponsive
afterwards, and you will have to wait a long time for the write cache to flush after the progress indication
has reached 100%. This effect is especially noticable on slow USB 2.0 disks.

We will be limitting I<< dd >>'s block size with "bs=100M". Beware that this makes I<< dd >>
consume 100 MiB of RAM during the whole operation.

I<< dd >>'s "oflag=sync" option will make it sync to disk from time to time. This will will not eliminate
the performance degradation, but will smooth it out over time. The final write-back flush time will
also be reduced considerably, as write operations will be evenly spread during the whole operation.

=item * Reliably report errors with a non-zero exit code.

By default, the shell ignores some of the error indications from pipe constructs.
Therefore, we will be using command "set -o pipefail". This is especially important when using I<< background.sh >>,
as the final "success" or "error" indication depends on the exit code.

=item * Compress the image file.

We will be using I<< gzip >> to (hopefully) reduce the image file size. It is probably best to favour speed
over compression level, so we will be using option "--fast". Otherwise, you will probably want to use
I<< bzip >> or I<< xz >> instead.

=back

If you want to store your disk image file on a FAT32 partition, you will easily hit the 4 GiB size limit.
We could also use I<< split >> to overcome this limitation.

The souped-up versions look as follows. You will always have to modify the parts in bold.

=head2 Make a disk image

C<< background.sh bash -c "set -o pipefail && sudo pv -ftpreb B<< /dev/sdxx >> | gzip --fast >\"B<< $HOME/some/dir/test.diskimage.gz >>\"" >>

=head2 Restore a disk image

C<< background.sh bash -c "set -o pipefail && pv -ftpreb \"B<< $HOME/some/dir/test.diskimage.gz >>\" | gunzip --to-stdout | sudo dd bs=100M oflag=sync B<< of=/dev/sdxx >>" >>

Note that the progress bar will not be very accurate, as I<< pv >> will be measuring the amount of data read from the compressed file.
If the disk image has large empty areas (filled with zeros), the time estimates will be off by a large margin.
For example, if the last disk sectors are empty, then the progress indicator will remain at 100% for a long time at the end.
The trouble is, the disk may be bigger than the image, and finding out the size of the uncompressed data is not trivial.

=head2 Wipe out a disk

C<< BLOCK_DEVICE=B<< /dev/sdxx >> background.sh bash -c "set -o pipefail && BLOCK_DEVICE_SIZE=\"\$(sudo blockdev --getsize64 \"\$BLOCK_DEVICE\")\" && dd bs=100M count=\$BLOCK_DEVICE_SIZE iflag=count_bytes if=/dev/zero | pv -ftpreb --size \$BLOCK_DEVICE_SIZE | sudo dd bs=100M oflag=sync of=\"\$BLOCK_DEVICE\"" >>

This one-liner just writes zeros to the whole disk or partition. In order to display an accurate progress bar,
we have to find out beforehand (with I<< blockdev >>) how big the disk is. We need to read with I<< dd >> because
there is no way to tell I<< pv >> to stop reading after the given number of bytes.
