update-with-apt.sh

Updates the Ubuntu/Debian system, like the "Software Updater" GUI tool does, but from the command line.

This is not trivial to do. The GUI updater uses a few APT tricks, and I had to invest
quite a lot of time to do the same with a script. This effort should not have been necessary,
for the system (or APT) should provide something equivalent.
