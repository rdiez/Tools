#!/bin/bash

# This script performs a cold backup of a libvirt virtual machine.
#
# Version 1.04.
#
# Usage:
#  ./BackupVm.sh  <VM ID>  <destination directory>
#
# If the virtual machine is already running, it shuts it down, and restarts it afterwards.
#
# The script asummes that all virtual disks are using QEMU's qcow2 format.
# Disk images are copied with qemu-img, so the resulting copy will usually shrink. Therefore,
# the target filesystem needs no sparse file support.
#
# I had to change the file permissions for this script to be able to access the VM disk without
# running as root:
#
#  sudo chgrp libvirt /var/lib/libvirt/images/YourVmDisk.qcow2
#  sudo chmod g+r     /var/lib/libvirt/images/YourVmDisk.qcow2
#
# This is problematic, because the file permissions change automatically,
# see libvirt's dynamic_ownership mode.
#
# Alternatively, this script could use "virsh vol-download", but:
# 1) Process "virsh vol-download" uses a lot of memory, as of january 2020, due to an internal
#    streaming architectural issue discussed here:
#      virsh vol-download uses a lot of memory
#      https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2020-January/msg00056.html
# 2) The XML parser should extract the pool name too, for the --pool parameter.
#
# The libvirt snapshot metadata is not backed up yet.
#
# The script's implementation is more robust than comparable scripts from the Internet. The whole script
# runs with error detection enabled. The elapsed time is printed after shuting down the virtual machine
# and after backing up a virtual disk, which helps measure performance.
#
# This script requires tool 'xmlstarlet'.
