# Bash checks environment variable INSIDE_EMACS and parses a little of it, and also checks

# Unfortunately, the decision whether to disable line editing is not made directly
# available to shell scripts.
#
# Duplicating the exact logic here is complicated, and it can change at any point in time.
# One option is just to do a simple check on TERM:  if [[ $TERM != "dumb" ]]; then ...

#   You can already check whether 'vi' or 'emacs' is enabled. If neither is
#   enabled, line editing is not enabled.
# This method will break if any new editing modes come, which, given the current Bash development status,
# is rather unlikely. Therefore, for the time being, this method should be OK.
