# You can set the method this tool uses to run processes with a lower priority with environment variable BACKGROUND_SH_LOW_PRIORITY_METHOD:
#
# - Method "nice" uses the 'nice' tool to lower the process' priority.
#
#   This is normally the best choice, as it is a POSIX standard. Under Linux, it has
#   an impact on both CPU and disk priority. See variable NICE_TARGET_PRIORITY below.
#
# - Method "ionice" uses command "ionice --class x --classdata y".
#
#   This method is specific to Linux and affects disk I/O priority only.
#   You may want to switch to this method if you are running long background calculations
#   (like BOINC with SETI@home) and you are using the "ondemand" CPU scaling governor
#   with setting "ignore_nice_load" enabled in order to keep your laptop from
#   heating up and its fan from getting loud. Otherwise, any process started with
#   the 'nice' method will run more slowly than it probably should, as the CPU will
#   not run at its maximum frequency.
#   See variables IONICE_xxx below for the exact values used.
#
# - Method "ionice+chrt" combines "ionice" as described above with "chrt", which
#   sets the CPU scheduling policy. See variable CHRT_PRIORITY below.
#
# - Method "systemd-run" uses 'systemd-run --nice=xx'.
#
# - Method "none" does not modify the child process' priority.

  echo "- You want to carry on using the computer for other tasks. That long process should run with a low CPU and/or disk priority in the background.

  echo "- [disabled] The log file should optimise away the carriage return trick often used to update a progress indicator in place on the current console line."
  echo "- You may not notice when the process has completed, so you would like a visible notification in your desktop environment (like KDE or Xfce)."
  echo "- You would like to know immediately if the process succeeded or failed (an exit code of zero would mean success)."
  echo "- You want to know how long the process took, in order to have an idea of how long it may take the next time around."

  echo "in your home directory. There is a .mailrc example file next to this script."
  echo
  echo "Caveat: If you start several instances of this script and you are using a fixed log filename (without log file rotation), you should do it from different directories. This script attempts to detect such a situation by creating a temporary lock file named after the log file and obtaining an advisory lock on it with flock (which depending on the underlying filesystem may have no effect)."
  echo
  echo "About the --memory-limit option:"
  echo "  The Linux filesystem cache is braindead (as of Kernel 5.0.0 in september 2019). Say you have 2 GiB of RAM and "
  echo "  you copy 2 GiB's worth of data from one disk directory to another. That will effectively flush the Linux"
  echo "  filesystem cache, and you don't even have to be root. Anything you want to do afterwards will have to reload"
  echo "  any other files needed from disk, which means that the system will always respond slowly after copying large files."
  echo
  echo "  In order to reduce the cache impact on other processes, I have looked for ways to limit cache usage."
  echo "  The only way I found is to set a memory limit in a cgroup, but unfortunately that affects all memory usage"
  echo "  within the cgroup, and not just the file cache. The only tool I found to painlessly create a temporary"
  echo "  cgroup is 'systemd-run', and even this way is not without rough edges."
  echo
  echo "  If your command hits the memory limit, the OOM killer will probably terminate the whole group, and the error message"
  echo "  will simply be 'Killed'. Unfortunately, the only alternative OOM behaviour is to pause processes until"
  echo "  more memory is available, which does not really work well in practice."
  echo "  Beware that sometimes setting the memory limit too low will not kill your process, but it will make it cause"
  echo "  'virtual memory thrashing', severely degrading overall system performance. I have seen this effect with"
  echo "  Ubuntu 18.04.4 and par2's argument -m ."
  echo
  echo "Exit status: Same as the command executed. Note that this script assumes that 0 means success."
  echo
  echo "Still to do:"
  echo "- This script could take optional parameters with the 'nice' level and the visual notification method."
  echo "- Linux 'cgroups', if available, would provide a better CPU and/or disk prioritisation."
  echo "- Under Cygwin on Windows there is not taskbar notification yet, only the message box is displayed. I could not find an easy way to create a taskbar notification with a .vbs or similar script."
  echo "- Log file rotation could be smarter: by global size, by date or combination of both."
