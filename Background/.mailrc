  # you may need to set this option to 'warn' or 'ignore'.

  # When sending messages, wait until the Mail-Transfer-Agent finishes.

  # When sending attachments, only use builtin MIME types, no mime.types(5) files.
  # That set is often sufficient, but look at the output of the
  # 'mimetype' command to ensure this is true for you, too.

  # if the "some.domain" hostname in variable 'smtp' does not match the "some.domain" part of the
  # sender e-mail address in the 'from' variable.
  #
  # On some e-mail providers, you may need to declare this automatic mailing tool as a "less secure app".

  # By having separate variables for user and password, you do not need to use a tool like 'urlencode'
  # in order to escape any 'special' characters before placing them in the 'smtp' variable above.
