This script deletes files from one directory which are duplicated in another reference directory.
The duplicate files must have the same relative path in both directories, the same filename and the same contents.

If you have two directory structures which are mostly the same, but you have modified files in both copies,
and you do not know anymore what files you should keep, merge or delete, this script will help you with
a first step of deleting obvious duplicates.

See the comments at the beginning of the script for more information.
