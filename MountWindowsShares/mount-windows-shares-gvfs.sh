#
# Warning: I have had a number of problems mit GVfs in the past,
#          so I am not actually using this script template anymore.
#
# Mounting Windows shares under Linux can be a frustrating affair.
# At some point in time, I decided to write this script template
# to ease the pain.
#
# This script helps in the following scenario:
# - You need to mount a given set of Windows file shares every day.
# - You have just one Windows account for all of them.
# - You do not mind using a text console.
# - You wish to mount with FUSE / GVfs, so that you do NOT need the root password.
#   This script uses tool 'gvfs-mount'.
# - You want your own symbolic link for every mountpoint, and not the unreadable
#   link that GVfs creates somewhere weird.
# - You do not want to store your root or Windows account password on the local
#   Linux PC. That means you want to enter the password every time, and the system
#   should forget it straight away.
# - Sometimes  mounting or unmounting a Windows share fails, for example with
#   error message "device is busy", so you need to retry.
#   This script should skip already-mounted shares, so that simply retrying
#   eventually works without further manual intervention.
# - Every now and then you add or remove a network share, but by then
#   you have already forgotten all the mount details and don't want
#   to consult the man pages again.
#
# With no arguments, or with argument 'mount', this script mounts all shares it knows about.
# Specify argument "umount" or "unmount" in order to unmount all shares.
#
# If you are having trouble unmounting a GVfs mountpoint because it is still in use,
# command "lsof | grep ^gvfs" might help. Tool "gvfs-mount --unmount" does not seem
# to have a "lazy unmount" option like 'umount' has, but maybe "--force" does the trick.
# You can unmount all GVfs SMB shares at once with the following command:
#   gvfs-mount --unmount-scheme=smb
#
# You'll have to edit this script in order to add your particular Windows shares.
# However, the only thing you will probably ever need to change
# is routine user_settings() below.
#
# A better alternative would be to use a graphical tool like Gigolo, which can
# automatically mount your favourite shares on start-up. Gigolo uses the FUSE-based
# mount system too, which does not require the root password in order to mount Windows shares.
# Unfortunately, I could not get it to work reliably unter Ubuntu 14.04 as of Mai 2014.
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#
# - You have to install GVfs and FUSE support on your Linux OS beforehand. On Debian, the packages
#   are called "gvfs-bin", "gvfs-backends" and "gvfs-fuse". You can install them with the
#   following command:
#     sudo apt-get install gvfs-bin gvfs-backends gvfs-fuse
#
# - (No longer necessary from Ubuntu 15.10) Your user account must be a member of the "fuse" group.
#   You can do that with the following command:
#     sudo adduser "$USER" fuse
#
# CAVEATS:
#
# - This script uses 'gvfs-mount', which has been deprecated in favour of a new 'gio' tool. The gio
#   tool was added in GNOME 3.22, and gvfs-mount was turned into a shell script that redirects to gio
#   in GNOME 3.24. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS does not have gio yet.
#
# - If you type the wrong password, tool 'gvfs-mount' will enter an infinite loop (as of Kubuntu 14.04 in Oct 2014,
#   gvfs version 1.20.1). As a result, this script will appear to hang.
#   The reason is that gvfs-mount does not realise when the stdin file descriptor reaches the end of file,
#   which is the case as this scripts redirects stdin in order to feed it with the password.
#   The only way out is to press Ctrl+C to interrupt the script together with all its child processes.
#   I reported this issue (see bug 742942 in https://bugzilla.gnome.org/) and it has been fixed for version 1.23).
#
#   The version that comes with Ubuntu 16.04 does have this fix. The only issue left is that no error message
#   is generated when gvfs-mount exits in this way. This is what the interaction looks like:
#     Mounting...
#     1: Mounting: //my-server/my-share
#     gvfs-mount -- smb://MY-DOMAIN\;my-user@my-server/my-share
#     Password required for share my-share on my-server
#     Password:
#     Password required for share my-share on my-server
#     Password:
#   The second password prompt hits then end-of-file on stdin. To avoid confusion, gvfs-mount should actually say
#   that the first password you supplied was wrong before prompting again. And it should print some error message
#   too about exiting because of an end-of-file condition.
#
# - GVfs seems moody. Sometimes, making a connection takes a long time without any explanation.
#   You will eventually get a timeout error message, but it is too long, it can take minutes.
#   Trying to access the mountpoints immediately after establishing the connection often
#   fails straight away with a generic "Input/output error".
#
#   On Kubuntu 14.04.1, I tend to get the following error message once per session, and then never again:
#     "Error mounting location: No such interface 'org.gtk.vfs.MountTracker' on object at path /org/gtk/vfs/mounttracker"
#
#   For more GVfs trouble, unresolved for years, see:
#   - Fuse prefix is not recognized for symlinked files during GFile object creation
#     https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/-/issues/283
#   - Add operations to support O_WRONLY and O_RDWR in fuse daemon
#     https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gvfs/-/issues/249
#
# - I could not connect to a Windows share with the german character "Eszett" (aka "scharfes S").
#   This character looks like the "beta" greek letter. I could not do it with tools 'gigolo' or
#   'smb4k' either, so something is probably wrong deep down in the system. I tested with Kubuntu 14.04
#   in Oct 2014, and again with Xubuntu 16.04.2 LTS and gvfs-mount 1.28.2 in July 2017.
#   Other international characters, like the German "a mit Umlaut", do work fine.
#
# - If a GVfs mount goes away in the meantime, running this script with the "unmount" argument
#   will leave the corresponding symbolic link behind.
#   The script could just delete any such links by name, but that may be wrong, as they may be pointing
#   to somewhere else useful at the moment.
#   The best way would be to parse the link targets, and check out if they match the expected Windows share.
#   However, such a corner case was not worth the development effort. Patches are welcome!
