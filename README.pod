=head1 rdiez's Tools

This repository contains some tools that I have written over the years. I hope that you find them useful too!

I have invested some extra time into making the tools robust and giving them reasonable help texts. Please send feedback to rdiezmail-tools at yahoo.de

The tools are:

=over

=item * B<< background.sh >>

Runs the given command with a low CPU and disk priority, keeps a log file, and
displays a visual notification or sends an e-mail when finished.

I could not live without this script anymore.

=item * B<< FilterTerminalOutputForLogFile.pl >>

Optimise away the carriage return trick often used to update a progress
indicator in place on the current console text line.

=item * B<< StartDetached.sh >>

Starts a program detached from the console, with its stdout and stderr redirected to syslog.

Useful when starting graphical applications that should not print to your shell session
random warnings at inconvenient times, and which should stay running after closing
the console window (do not automatically get SIGHUP).

=item * B<< xsudo.sh >>

A simple wrapper for pkexec as a substitute for gksudo.

=item * B<< CountdownTimer.pl >>

A countdown timer, like a kitchen timer for your perfect cup of tea.

=item * B<< DesktopNotification.sh >>

A little script to display a simple desktop notification.
I use it for example from KTimer to alert me when a timer has expired. 

=item * B<< File Read Test >>

The File Read Test tools read disk files or directories and stop on the first read error.
There are two alternatives to choose from: a Java application (with a point-and-click
user interface) and a perl script (to use from the command-line).

This tool has its own website at L<< http://filereadtest.sourceforge.net >>C< >.

=item * B<< Quick Disk Test >>

Quick Disk Test fills a disk with test data and verifies that it can be read back without errors.

This tool is only available as a Java application. Check out
its website at L<< http://filereadtest.sourceforge.net >>C< >.

=item * B<< copy-with-rsync.sh >> and B<< move-with-rsync.sh >>

If you often copy around large amounts of data, want to resume interrupted transfers, and can never remember rsync's flags,
copy-with-rsync.sh should help.

If you try to move files and subdirectores with 'mv' overwriting any existing ones,
you may come across the infamous "directory not empty" error message.
Script move-with-rsync.sh uses rsync to work-around this issue.

=item * B<< Disk Images With Progress >>

This is not actually script, but an article about displaying a progress indication
while creating or restoring disk images, or while wiping a disk.

=item * B<< burn-cd.sh >>

You would normally use an application like Brasero to burn CD-ROMs (or DVD-ROMs, etc).
But sometimes you need to automate the process, so that it is faster or more reliable.

I found CD burning hard to automate. I hope that this script helps.

=item * B<< mount-windows-shares.sh >>

Script templates to help mount Windows network file shares with the traditional Linux I<< mount >> method
or with GVFS/FUSE (so that you do not need I<< root >> privileges).

=item * B<< mount-encrypted-filesystem.sh >>

Conveniently mount and unmount an EncFS encrypted filesystem on a USB stick or a similar portable drive.

=item * B<< mount-strato.sh >>

The script I use to 'comfortably' mount the Strato Hidrive over WebDAV on my Linux PC,
and then mount an EncFS encrypted filesystem (or 2 of them) on top of it.

=item * B<< MountMyRamdiskIfNecessary.sh >>

This script creates and mounts a RAM disk (tmpfs) at a fixed location, if not already mounted.

A RAM disk can dramatically speed-up certain operations, such as building software with many small files.

=item * B<< takeownership.sh >>

Little convenience script to take ownership of a given file or directory (recursively).

=item * B<< ResetWindowsFilePermissions.bat >>

Resets file permissions under a given directory on a Microsoft Windows system.

=item * B<< NoPassword scripts >>

These scripts help you configure I<< sudo >> and I<< polkit >> to stop password prompting
for the commands or privileged actions of your choice.

=item * B<< Sandboxing Skype >>

These scripts help you sandox Skype under Linux.

=item * B<< Office Software Automation >>

=over

=item * B<< PromptAndProcess.vbs (for Windows) >>

Sometimes you need to write a small script that lets a user select a file
and do some operation on it, like convert it to another format.
This script provides a full-blown example for a simple file copy operation.

=item * B<< PromptForFile.vbs (for Windows/Cygwin) >>

Prompts the user for a file with Windows' standard "open file" dialog,
and prints the selected filename to stdout. Useful for Cygwin bash scripts.

=item * B<< ConvertWordToPDFWithBackground.vbs (for Windows) >>

Converts a Microsoft Word document to a PDF file, and then generates a second PDF file
with extra content in the background (typically a letterhead or watermark) on all pages.

Adds extra content in the background (typically a letterhead or watermark)
to all pages of a PDF document.

=item * B<< CopyToOldVersionsArchive.vbs (for Windows) >>

the file there. The current date and time are appended to the archived filename.

=back

=item * B<< RemoteControlPrompt.sh >>

Helps the user connect to a listening VNC viewer.

=item * B<< VirtualMachineManager/start-and-connect-to-vm.sh >>

=item * B<< repeat.bat >>

Cheap clone of I<< watch >> for Microsoft Windows.

=item * B<< print-arguments-wrapper.sh >>

When writing complex shell scripts, sometimes you wonder if a particular process is getting the right arguments and the
right environment variables. Just prefix a command with the name of this script, and it will dump all arguments and
environment variables to the console before starting the child process.

=item * B<< WaitForSignals.sh >>

Waits for Unix signals to arrive.
This script is mainly useful during development or troubleshooting of Linux processes.

Runs the given shell command in a new console window.

=item * B<< RotateDir.pl >>

If you keep running a process that generates a big directory tree every time (like building a compiler toolchain
overnight), and you only want to keep the most recent file trees, this directory rotation tool will automatically prune
the older ones for you.

=item * B<< AnnotateWithTimestamps.pl >>

Prints a text line for each byte read, with timestamp, time delta,
byte value and ASCII character name.

Useful when troubleshooting data timing issues.

until the specified file size has been reached.

=item * B<< GenerateRangeMappingTable.pl >>

and another numeric range (integer or floating point).
The mapping can be linear or exponential.

=item * B<< ConvertBitmapToSourceCode.pl >>

Converts a bitmap in Portable Pixmap format (PPM) format, monochrome or RGB565, into a C++ array. RGB565 is a very popular 16-bit color depth format among small hardware devices.

=item * B<< decode-jtag-idcode.pl >>

used to start it, and runs another script after the given delay. Useful to
start delayed tasks from KDE's braindead "autostart" feature. Otherwise,
you'll have to write a little script with the right full path and an eventual
I<< sleep >> statement every time.

=item * B<< email-news-feeds.sh >>

Helper script to automatically run tool 'rss2email' after every login, in order to get your news
conveniently delivered to your mailbox.

=item * B<< script-speed-test.sh >>

Cleans a git repository, see the comments in the script source code for details.

=item * B<< git-revert-file-permissions.sh >>

Later note: This script probably does not work on recent Linux kernel versions.

=item * B<< Fake Replacement for Debian Package I<< apt-xapian-index >> >>

It is well known (as of may 2014) that I<< update-apt-xapian-index >> consumes loads of
memory and can easily render a computer with only 512 MiB of RAM unusable.

This fake APT package helps get rid of the whole I<< apt-xapian-index >> package in Ubuntu
or Debian systems without collateral dependency damage.

=item * B<< I<< mlocate >> Conflicting Package >>

The I<< locate >> background indexer can grind your Linux PC to a halt every now and then for several minutes at a time.

Most tools are licensed under the AGPLv3, see file F<< agpl-3.0.txt >> for details.

Use script F<< GenerateLinks.sh >> to place symbolic links to the most-used scripts
into a directory of your choice (which is normally your personal 'Tools' or 'Utils' directory in the PATH).
