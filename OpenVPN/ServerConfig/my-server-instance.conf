# Do not attempt to use a shared secret key like this:
#   secret static.key
# It will not work in the end. Unfortunately, you have to bite the bullet and use certificates.
#
# Security is a pain with OpenVPN. It is very expensive for a small business to deal with a certificate authority.
# The idea that every signed certificate grants you access is also detriment to security.
# Employees will come and go, so you will have to revoke certificates.
#
# As of November 2021, the following example configuration file does not mention the 'crl-verify' option:
#    https://github.com/OpenVPN/openvpn/blob/master/sample/sample-config-files/server.conf
# This is a serious documentation issue. The unwary will believe that the example configuration file
# is sufficient, but it is not. Revocation is necessay, and implementing it is unnecessarily expensive.
#
# OpenVPN revocation works as a blacklist, which is not a very reliable method. Make a small system configuration
# mistake, and all revoked certificates work again. This is why I am using a tls-verify script
# instead of relying on revocation.
#
# The kind of security you really want here is a white list of shared secrets, one per client.
# OpenVPN should then implement automatic perfect forward secrecy for all such client connections.
#
# Note that upcoming OpenVPN version 2.6 will have an option named "--peer-fingerprint" to provide
# an easier alternative to tls-verify.

ca   my-server-instance/ca.crt      # Certificate authority for the server and all the clients, aka the root certificate.
cert my-server-instance/server.crt  # This server's signed certificate.
key  my-server-instance/server.key  # This server's private key.
dh   my-server-instance/dh2048.pem  # Parameters for the Diffie Hellman key exchange.

# 'tls-auth' adds an additional layer of HMAC authentication on top of the TLS control channel
# to mitigate DoS attacks and attacks on the TLS stack.
# The second parameter should be '0' on the server and '1' on the clients.
#
# You can also switch to tls-crypt, which uses the key file not only to authenticate,
# but also to encrypt the TLS control channel.
#   tls-auth my-server-instance/ta.key  0
tls-crypt my-server-instance/ta.key

# Upgrade the fallback cryptographic cipher for the data channel, because the default BF-CBC is too weak.
# A different option named tls-cipher controls the cipher used by the control channel.
# This config item must be copied to the client config file as well.
# Note that v2.4 client/server will automatically negotiate an upgrade to AES-256-GCM in TLS mode.
# See also the ncp-cipher option in the manpage.
# With the upcoming OpenVPN version 2.6, this option is a no-op in TLS mode.

# We need to relax the external program security restriction, because we need to call the tls-verify script.
script-security 2

# Option 'tls-verify' is full of shortcomings. It is expensive to spawn an external process for each
# certificate verification depth. And you need to relax the 'script-security' option to be able
# to launch this external script.
# It would have been better to start this script once, before OpenVPN drops security privileges.
# Then the script should forever read text lines with the certificate data to validate,
# and answer for example on stdout.
# Or even better: OpenVPN should have built-in support for such a common case of whitelisting clients.

# The first IP address after "server-bridge" is passed down to the client as "route-gateway x.x.x.x".
# The second and third IP addresses delimit the DHCP range for OpenVPN clients. Make sure that your
# local DHCP server will no hand those addresses out to normal LAN clients.

# Certain Windows-specific network settings can be pushed to clients, such as DNS or WINS server addresses.
# We can push a WINS server address here too, see the manpage for details. But WINS servers
# are long deprecated in favour of DNS.
#
# These DHCP options are currently ignored by Linux OpenVPN clients. However, they can be passed as environment variables
# to an external script which can then honour them. See the documentation for OpenVPN's --dhcp-option for more information.

# The keepalive directive causes ping-like messages to be sent back and forth over
# the link so that each side knows when the other side has gone down.
# Ping every 2 seconds and assume that remote peer is down if no ping is received

# Note that the values pushed from server will override the client local values.

# Option 'status' outputs a short status file showing current connections, truncated and rewritten every minute.
#
#   status /var/log/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
#
# I am not sure how this file is created and updated. This may affect reliability. If the file is updated in place,
# and some process is reading it at the same time, the list of connections may get corrupted.
#
# Option 'status-version' controls the file format, but none of the formats is properly documented,
# at least as of april 2019.
#
# There does not seem to be any option to control the file permissions.
#
# As an alternative, see the 'management' option.
#
# If you want to manually have a look at the current connections,
# this status information can also be written to the syslog by sending a SIGUSR2 signal.
#
# If you just want to see what clients have connected recently, look for lines like the following
# in the server log file. These lines get written from a log verbosity level 1 onwards:
#
#   [clientname] Peer Connection Initiated with [AF_INET]192.168.100.xxx:32864
#
# Note that, under Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, the default systemd service configuration passes the following command-line argument:
#   --status %t/openvpn-server/status-%i.log
# Therefore, the log file may already be active on your system, usually with a filename like this:
#   /run/openvpn-server/status-my-server-instance.log

# Set the appropriate level of log file verbosity (optional).
#
# 0 is silent, except for fatal errors
# 4 is reasonable for general usage
# 5 and 6 can help to debug connection problems
# 9 is extremely verbose
verb 4

# Silence repeating messages. At most 20 sequential messages of the same message
# category will be output to the log.
# This is rarely useful, because it does not suppress the same messages, but any messages
# of the same type.
