     #
     # There seems to be 2 ccache areas, and configuration setting CONFIG_CCACHE seems to enable both of them.
     #
     # Area 1) Host compilation.
     #         The OpenWrt build system downloads and builds many of the host build tools it needs,
     #         for example, a newer version of ccache itself.
     #         It is unclear from what point OpenWrt uses its own ccache, as opposed to the systems' ccache.
     #         The ccache hit rate in this area seems very low. I wonder why.
     #         One test I could do is to uninstall the system's ccache and see whether OpenWrt tries to use it.
     #
     # Area 2) Target compilation.
     #         In this area, ccache is only worth using if you are cleaning and rebuilding the target executables
     #         on the same sandbox over and over. Sharing ccache's cache between sandboxes could be problematic.
     #
     # In addition to the "version" file, we could also generate or overwrite file "version.date".
     # That could give ccache a better chance at really caching compilations.
     # This file is present in release branches, but not in the 'master' branch.
     # For more information, see scripts/get_source_date_epoch.sh .
     #
     # - The OpenWrt buildbot shows how to use ccache's compiler_check setting, see repository buildbot.git, file scripts/ccache.sh .
     #
     # - It looks like OpenWrt generates about 270 GiB of object files in the host's cache.
     #
     #   There are more notes about ccache in my script BuildOpenWrt-X86_64-FromScratch.sh .
     #
     #   [doch?]  Despite the config change, ccache does not seem to get used. Why is that?
     #
     #   This is one example of ccache invocation:
     #
     #     ccache gcc -I/home/rdiez/rdiez/freifunk/openwrt/git-repo/staging_dir/host/include -DHAVE_CONFIG_H
     #     -DSYSCONFDIR=\"/home/rdiez/rdiez/freifunk/openwrt/git-repo/staging_dir/host/etc\" -DCPU_x86_64 -DVENDOR_pc
     #     -DOS_linux_gnu -O2 -I/home/rdiez/rdiez/freifunk/openwrt/git-repo/staging_dir/host/include -Wall -fno-strict-aliasing -I.
     #     -I.  -c fat.c
     #
     #   It is not clear whether it is using the system's ccache, or building its own ccache:
     #
     #     /usr/bin/install -c -m 755 ccache /home/rdiez/rdiez/freifunk/openwrt/git-repo/staging_dir/host/bin
     #
     #   I could find out by:
     #   1) Removing ccache from the system.
     #   2) Changing the ccache repo in the system.
     #
     #   OpenWrt is using its private copy here:
     #     /home/rdiez/rdiez/freifunk/openwrt/git-repo/staging_dir/host/bin
     #
     #   The ccache's cache dir seems to be here:
     #     staging_dir/host/ccache
     #
     #   Here is a confirmation:
     #     https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel
     #
     #   Maybe we should be setting this environment variable: CCACHE_DIR=~/.ccache
     #
     #   Does ccache realise when the compiler has changed? Probably yes.
     #   And it probably will not work properly then for our OpenWrt sandbox.
     #   Look at ccache's config file option "compiler_check".
     #
     # I am getting these warnings:
     # Does this happen with Git 'master' too?

# About redirecting stdin to /dev/null before running this script:
#
#   The build commands below are designed to run unattended. They should not need
#   anything from stdin. If they do, that is unexpected, and they should fail straight away.
#   That's why redirecting stdin to /dev/null is a good idea.
#
#   OpenWrt's makefile does not determine correctly whether it is running inside a terminal,
#   see this bug report of mine:
#     FS#2086 - IS_TTY in the makefile is broken
#     https://bugs.openwrt.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=2086
#   The makefile checks stdin instead of stdout. Therefore, redirecting stdin to /dev/null
#   also disables terminal colour codes in the build output, which is often desirable
#   if you are keeping a build log as a text file.
#
# Rather than relying on OpenWrt's makefile, this script tests stdout itself and decides
# whether to colour the output or not.
