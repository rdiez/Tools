# This script helps you configure polkit to stop password prompting
# for the privileged actions of your choice.
#
# This works best for GUI applications that use polkit. For command-line tools
# it is best to use companion script nopassword-sudo.sh .
#
# Make sure you have set environment variable SUDO_EDITOR, so that 'sudoedit'
# can open the apropriate configuration file for you to edit.

# Version 1.8.16 of sudo/sudoedit that ships with Ubuntu 16.04 has the following bug:
#
#   A change made in sudo 1.8.15 inadvertantly caused sudoedit to
#   send itself SIGHUP instead of exiting when the editor returns
#   an error or the file was not modified.
#
# That bug was fixed in sudo 1.8.21.
#
# With the buggy versions, and without the following 'trap' command, you get this kind
# of message (the system is localized to Spain):
#   sudoedit: /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/49-my_personal_no_password_global.pkla unchanged
#   ./nopassword-polkit.sh: linea 109:  4466 Colgar (hangup)         sudoedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/49-my_personal_no_password_global.pkla
# That seems to indicate that the current Bash instance does receive the SIGHUP signal.
# With the following 'trap' command, we cannot actually run any code in this shell when the trap is sent/received
# (function sighup_handler is never actually called), I do not know why yet. But at least the received signal message is shorter.
#   trap "sighup_handler" HUP
# After installing the trap, this is what the printed message looks like:
#   sudoedit: /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/49-my_personal_no_password_global.pkla unchanged
#   Colgar (hangup)
# Using 'trap "" HUP' in order to ignore the signal has the same effect: the message is just shorter.

# When the child process dies because of SIGHUP, it yields a non-zero exit code.
